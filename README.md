# kicad2mcad
Convert KiCad PCB file to MCAD (IGES/STEP)

This project aims to provide a tool to convert KiCad PCB
files into IGES or STEP solid model assemblies. The long
term plan is to eventually integrate this code with the
main KiCad source.

The source has only been built and tested on Linux; any
feedback on build instructions for OSX/MSWin would be
welcome.
